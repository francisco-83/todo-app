This is my first JS todo app after almost completing Head First JavaScript book.

My thought process

// Process: start with the logic, what does the progam needs to do?
// Besides HTML and CSS, the goal was to Take the input value and pass it to a container. For this I needed an event handler for the button
// The second step was to figure out how to mark each item completed.
// Add a button to clean the items
// Figure out a way to make data persistent
// Enahaced styles
// Add more features.
